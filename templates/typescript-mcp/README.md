# TypeScript MCP Template

This template provides a complete example of building AI-powered chat-over-data applications with MooseStack and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

This README covers the **quickstart** — getting the template running locally. For a full guided walkthrough including data modeling, loading data from S3, customizing the frontend, and deploying to production, see the [Chat in Your App Guide](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/guides/chat-in-your-app/tutorial).

## Overview

This is a pnpm monorepo containing two independent applications that work together:

```text
Next.js App (Chat UI -> API Route -> MCP Client)
    | HTTP + Bearer Token |
MooseStack Service (Tools -> MCP Server -> ClickHouse)
```

- **`packages/moosestack-service/`** — MooseStack backend with a custom MCP server, built using [BYO API](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moosestack/app-api-frameworks) and Express
- **`packages/web-app/`** — Next.js frontend with a pre-configured AI chat interface

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v20+ and pnpm v8+
- Docker Desktop (running)
- Moose CLI: `bash -i <(curl -fsSL https://fiveonefour.com/install.sh) moose`
- [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/)

## Getting Started

Install MooseStack (and optionally the 514-hosting) CLIs:

```bash
bash -i <(curl -fsSL https://fiveonefour.com/install.sh) moose,514
```

Initiate your project:

```bash
moose init <project-name> typescript-mcp
cd <project-name>
```

Install dependencies for both applications:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Copy example environment variables:

```bash
cp packages/moosestack-service/.env.{example,local}
cp packages/web-app/.env.{example,local}
```

Create API Key authentication tokens:

```bash
cd packages/moosestack-service
moose generate hash-token # use output for the API Key & Token below
```

Set environment variables. `moose generate hash-token` outputs a key pair — the hash goes to the backend and the token goes to the frontend:

| Variable | File | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MCP_API_KEY` | `packages/moosestack-service/.env.local` | `ENV API Key` (hash) from `moose generate hash-token` |
| `MCP_API_TOKEN` | `packages/web-app/.env.local` | `Bearer Token` from `moose generate hash-token` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `packages/web-app/.env.local` | Your [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/) |

Start both services:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Or start services individually:

```bash
pnpm dev:moose    # Start MooseStack service only
pnpm dev:web      # Start web app only
```

`pnpm dev:moose` loads the MooseStack Development Server and MooseDev MCP.

Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`. Click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to open the chat panel. This generates an empty template application, if you want to customize the application or chat tools, see [Chat in Your App Guide](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/guides/chat-in-your-app/tutorial).

If you want to use MooseStack skills, bootstrap them with:

```bash
514 agent init
```

This installs the following skills:

- **ClickHouse Best Practices** — Schema design, query optimization, and insert strategy rules with MooseStack-specific examples
- **514 CLI** — Interact with the 514 platform (login, link project, check deployments, browse docs)
- **514 Debug** — Debug 514 deployments (check status, tail logs, find slow queries, run diagnostics)
- **514 Perf Optimize** — Guided ClickHouse performance optimization workflow with benchmarking

If you start your copilot now, you will have the MooseStack Skills, LSP, and MCPs up and running.

### Local Development Ports

Make sure the following ports are free before running `pnpm dev`. If any are in use, you can change them in `packages/moosestack-service/moose.config.toml`.

| Service              | Port  |
| -------------------- | ----- |
| Next.js web app      | 3000  |
| MooseStack HTTP/MCP  | 4000  |
| Management API       | 5001  |
| Temporal             | 7233  |
| Temporal UI          | 8080  |
| ClickHouse HTTP      | 18123 |
| ClickHouse native    | 9000  |

### Agent Harness

This template ships with an agent harness — a set of tools that give your AI copilot full context over the project:

- **[MooseDev MCP](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moosestack/moosedev-mcp)** — MooseStack's built-in MCP server for querying your local database and inspecting your data pipeline (requires `pnpm dev:moose` running)
- **[Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7)** — serves up-to-date MooseStack documentation to your copilot
- **[ClickHouse Best Practices Skill](https://github.com/514-labs/agent-skills)** — optimized query and schema guidance for ClickHouse

The MCP servers are pre-configured in `.mcp.json` and most AI copilots (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) pick them up automatically.

## Connecting External MCP Clients

This template exposes a custom MCP server at `/tools` (separate from MooseStack's [built-in MCP server](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moosestack/moosedev-mcp) at `/mcp`). You can connect external MCP clients to it:

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http moose-tools http://localhost:4000/tools --header "Authorization: Bearer <your_bearer_token>"
```

### Other clients (mcp.json)

Create or update your `mcp.json` configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "moose-tools": {
      "transport": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:4000/tools",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <your_bearer_token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<your_bearer_token>` with the Bearer Token generated by `moose generate hash-token`.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 4000 is already in use, update `packages/moosestack-service/moose.config.toml`:

```toml
[http_server_config]
port = 4001
```

### "MCP_SERVER_URL environment variable is not set"

This is pre-configured in `packages/web-app/.env.development` for local dev. If you've deleted that file, recreate it:

```dotenv
MCP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

### "Unauthorized" or 401 Errors

- Verify `MCP_API_KEY` in `packages/moosestack-service/.env.local` matches the hash from `moose generate hash-token`
- Confirm `MCP_API_TOKEN` in `packages/web-app/.env.local` is the Bearer Token (not the hash)
- Check Authorization headers in network requests

### CORS Errors

- Ensure the chat UI calls `/api/chat` (same-origin)
- Backend requests to MooseStack use server-side Bearer token

### Chat Panel Missing

- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `ChatLayoutWrapper` wraps the app in `layout.tsx`
- Confirm shadcn/ui components are installed

### "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set"

- Add your key to `packages/web-app/.env.local`
- Restart the Next.js dev server (env vars load on startup)

### TypeScript Errors

Make sure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Extending This Template

### Adding More Tools

Register additional tools in `packages/moosestack-service/app/apis/mcp.ts` using `server.registerTool()`. Each tool needs a name, title, description, input/output schemas (using Zod), and an async handler function.

### Adding More Data Models

Create additional data models in `packages/moosestack-service/app/ingest/models.ts` by defining interfaces and creating OlapTable instances.

## Security Features

This template implements several security measures for safe database querying:

- **Readonly SQL Queries**: enforced by the ClickHouse client. For additional safety, you can also provision a [read-only ClickHouse user](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/permissions-for-queries)
- **Row Limiting**: Results are capped at a default of 100 rows, configurable up to 1000
- **Error Handling**: Security errors returned through MCP protocol without exposing internals

Before deploying to production, consider adding rate limiting, query timeouts, audit logging, IP whitelisting, and TLS/HTTPS.
